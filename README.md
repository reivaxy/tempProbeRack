# Temperature probe rack

I recently bought an oven thermometer than can handle 6 different probes but comes with 4 out of the box.

SO I have printed this very simple rack to store them. Variables make it easy to ajust the number of probes, if neeeded.

I printed several, using ABS that was not protected against humidity which might be the cause for the brownish hue.
